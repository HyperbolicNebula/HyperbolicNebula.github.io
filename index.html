      <h2>What Is The Clothing <span class="lab-light">Lab</span>?</h2>
      
      <p>The Clothing <span class="lab-light">Lab</span> is a project that seeks to unravel the mass-produced pieces that very often don't fit our needs. Clothes and fashion try to impose a new reality upon our bodies as opposed to conforming to their surfaces. Nevertheless, as part of the human right to health and well-being, clothing should in fact help us feel good about ourselves and our bodies. Frankly, your life is a work of art: I want to help you make more of it.</p>
      
      <p>Far too many people suffer from the clothing headache that includes:<br />- finding clothing we like<br />- fitting rooms and crowds<br />- size, fit, and shape<br />- dressing difficulty<br />- excessive shrinkage<br />- garment longevity<br />- repair difficulty</p>

      <p>As a matter of fact, some of the largest issues with clothing are that they don't bring us joy and that ultimately it's difficult to find something we truly like. The Clothing <span class="lab-light">Lab</span> specifically seeks to cater to those who have specific difficulties with clothing, whether that's regarding fit, size, function, dressing ease, gender, or style. Tackling such issues is a process of creating and wearing joy, even when it feels far out of reach.</p>

      <p>Clothing is not rocket science. You don't need a Ph.D to repair a seam, but companies have complicated the lifecycle of garments. Concededely, there exists a hint of math and science to completely understand textiles, dyes, and curvature, but that's why you can come to The Clothing <span class="lab-light">Lab</span>. Ultimately, garments become the body, the art, and the life we breathe into them.</p>
