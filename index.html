      <h2>What Is The Clothing <span class="lab-light">Lab</span>?</h2>
      <p>The Clothing <span class="lab-light">Lab</span> is a project that seeks to unravel mass-produced pieces that very often don't fit our needs. Clothes and fashion try to impose a new reality upon our bodies as opposed to conforming to their surfaces. Nevertheless, as part of the human right to health and well-being, clothing should in fact help us feel good about ourselves and our bodies. Frankly, your life is a work of art: I want to help you make more of it.</p>
      <p>Far too many people suffer from the headache that includes:</p>
      <p>  - fitting rooms</p>
      <p>  - lack of clothes that fit</p>
      <p>  - clothes that are difficult to put on</p>
      <p>  - excessive shrinkage</p>
      <p>  - garment longevity</p>
