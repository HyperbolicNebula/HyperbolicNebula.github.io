      <h2>What Is The Clothing <span class="lab-light">Lab</span>?</h2>
      
      <p>The Clothing <span class="lab-light">Lab</span> is a project that seeks to unravel mass-produced pieces that very often don't fit our needs. Clothes and fashion try to impose a new reality upon our bodies as opposed to conforming to their surfaces. Nevertheless, as part of the human right to health and well-being, clothing should in fact help us feel good about ourselves and our bodies. Frankly, your life is a work of art: I want to help you make more of it.</p>
      
      <p>Far too many people suffer from the clothing headache that includes:<br />- finding clothing we like<br />- fitting rooms and crowds<br />- size, fit, and shape<br />- dressing difficulty<br />- excessive shrinkage<br />- garment longevity<br />- repair difficulty</p>
